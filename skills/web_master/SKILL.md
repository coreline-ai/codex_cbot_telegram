# Web Master Orchestrator Skill (`web_master`)

This is the central nervous system for your web generation needs. Instead of manual tool management, `web_master` acts as a Senior Architect, coordinating a suite of specialized skills to deliver a production-ready web package from just a simple brief.

## Master Workflow

1. **Intelligence (`web_recon`)**: Benchmarks competition and niche leaders.
2. **Strategy (`web_copyexpert`)**: Crafts persuasive, SEO-optimized marketing copy.
3. **Drafting (`web_variator`)**: Produces multiple design directions for user approval.
4. **Assembly (`web_gen`)**: Builds the chosen design with local assets (`image_gen`).
5. **Polishing (`web_motion`)**: Injects premium animations and interactions.
6. **QC (`web_auditor`)**: Performs final validation for responsiveness and performance.
